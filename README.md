# Desktop-Clock

## 'Always on top' transparent Desktop Clock gadget for Windows 10

* Missing the Windows 7 Gadgets, and 
* trying to go around the fact that https://8gadgetpack.net/ does not allow you to show the gadgets 'always on top', 
* I came around with this easy Python solution using python tkinter library. Using my entire screen with various opened apps, this reminds me that I need to go on specific meetings at specific hours, even if I am concentrated doing something else.

# Run the Desktop-Clock at startup

* Open the Run dialog with WindowsKey+R and enter shell:startup
* Copy the Desktop-Clock file saved as a .pyw file
